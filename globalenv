# This is for configuring the global environment setup - which impacts things like
#
# - What is the default theme used for Storybook
# - What is the global overrides used in testing etc
#
# These are variables you would change in a client project. Note that changing some of
# these will impact JEST snapshots - and thus introduce large number of local changes
# making upstream merge and contribution difficult
#
# You can place a file named `client-packages/globalenv` which will
# override the global definition
#
# Besides the variables document in here, you can put any
# variable used in .env files
