# Studio App

The EXO studio app is intended to be an entry point in to managing the various data entities exposed from EXO

I may eventually include features such as:

1. Querying of data
2. CRUD operations on selected entities
3. Localization
4. Exposing additional/custom attributes
5. Rule based correction/modifications to data
6. Expose data to e.g. Jupyter notebooks
7. Data quality measurements
