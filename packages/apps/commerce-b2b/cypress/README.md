# Visual Regression (Experimental)

This package contains tests that tries to check for visual regression - i.e. 
taking a screenshot of a rendered page and comparing this to a pre-recorder 
good state screenshot (very similar to snapshot testing used in the unit test 
suite).

At the moment, this is *expermintal* and we do NOT encourage writing additional
tests in this manner before we conclude it's value over time.
